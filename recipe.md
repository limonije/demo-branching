## INSTRUCTIONS

1. **Base layer:**
2. In a food processor blend the cashews first into a flour like consistency which will usually take up to 1-2 minutes.   
Add the dates, and the coconut oil, and blend until it all starts to come together, this should take 2-3 mins.
3. Line an 8 inch spring form cake tin or 20cm with baking parchment. Pour the blended base into your lined spring form   
cake tin and spread it out evenly and compact it firmly into the base of the spring form tart, ensuring an even spread.   
If you place a little baking parchment on top of the mixture and use a spoon to spread it out it makes it easier.
4. **Caramel layer:** 
5. In the same food processor add all ingredients for the caramel layer and blend until super smooth and caramel-like,  
this may take from 5 to 10 mins and you may need to add a little more water if it is a bit clumpy and not blending!   
Blend until it goes like a lovely smooth brown toffee like colour. 
6. Once ready, spread a really even layer of caramel on top of the base layer, doing your best to give a smooth top   
for the chocolate layer, again if you place some baking parchment on top of the caramel and use a spoon to spread it out,   
this makes it easier.
7. **Chocolate layer:**
8. Melt the chocolate and coconut oil by making a water bath/ban-marie. Pour the chocolate layer over the caramel layer   
and spread evenly doing your best to ensure an even spread. Leave to set in the fridge for at least half 1 hr until   
the chocolate is solid.
9. Decorate with some coarse salt flakes.  
10. Use a hot knife to cut this cake in order to be able to cut through the chocolate without it cracking.
